# October 3 commit

The database is set up and good to go.
I have used mongodb cloud db. This is for development purpose, obviously not for deployment purpose.

## Note

since i have used a new package, use `npm install mongoose` in the server folder before u start using

## Verify the entries

try giving any new entries in the form application and it will be uploaded in the database. How would u know it.
Just run the test.js file. because u can't really access my mongo cloud. (too complicated)

- go to server folder and run `node test.js`
- this is to be done after u have given any new entries in the localhost server.
- u can find ur latest entry there
