## September 17 commit ->

Footer is complete. Application form is yet to be completed. I am planning on doing it tommorrow. Would appreciate your help! :)

## September 27 commit ->

Set up the Node.js backend and basic routing. Also created a 404 page wtih basic styling.
Served static files without express.js

## October 1 commit ->

Dei i finally figured out date time strings and i kind of initialized the form. The input given in the front-end (browser) is available in the console at the backend. (node server console). Check it out and revert back.

## Important note .

I have added a few new dependencies, so make sure to run `npm install` again on the server directory. you may not need to run it on the client folder. that was unnecessary i should say xD.
